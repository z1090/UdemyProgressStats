# UdemyProgressStats
A simple website that offers more detailed progress stats than the basic ones offered by Udemy.com. Not a UX or UI showcase! 😁

This is really just for me to gain experience building an express app from scratch with some simple API routing.

Next step: try to implement a headless browser to get the course info in a more user-friendly way...
